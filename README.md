##THE AMAZING QUIZZINATOR!

This application is a simple web based quiz, the intent is to be able to save your highscore at the end of the quiz and have it displayed on the leader board as well as to include a timer that goes down when getting the answer to question wrong.

the main issues I ran into with this project was getting the timer to work at all as well as the highscores displaying from localstorage, everything else is functional, and the code sorts scores submissions in the localstorage in decending values, however making them display is giving me issues.
